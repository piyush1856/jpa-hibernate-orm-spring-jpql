JPA api belongs from "javax.persistence" package.

--Hibernate is one of the most frequently used JPA implementation
--HB provides its own api to develop ORM based persistence logic , if we use those api then
our application will become vendor lock, i.e we can not port our application across multiple
ORM s/w.

--HB api comes in the form of "org.hibernate" package.
