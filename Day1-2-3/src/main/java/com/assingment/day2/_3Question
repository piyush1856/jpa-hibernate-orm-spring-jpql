Q3/- What is the Difference between the Java Bean class and the POJO class.


POJO class:-  java bean class:
---------------

Plain old java object

--it is a normal java class not bounded with any technology or f/w s/ws.
i.e a java class that is not implementing or extending technology/framework api related
classes or interfaces.




--a java  class that can be compiled without adding any extra jar files in the classpath are known
as a POJO class.

POJI (plain old java interface )

Note:- every java bean class is a POJO but every POJO is not a  java bean.




--the following class comes under the category of POJO class
class X implments Serializable, Runnable{

}


--this class does not comes under POJO
class X implements Servlet{

}


public class X {

public X(int x){

}

}

--above class is a POJO class but it is not a java bean class.becoz of parameterized constructor.
