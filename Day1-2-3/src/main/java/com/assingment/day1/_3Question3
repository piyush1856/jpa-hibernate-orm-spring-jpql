Q3/- What are the different phases of the Maven life cycle?



maven build life cycle contains diff phases:

1. validate: - in this phase it will verify the project directory structure is valid or not. and if it has pom.xml file
                is present or not.

2.compile: maven compiles all the source code of the project by downloading and adding required jar files in the classpath.

3.test-compile: if we have written any unit test cases those code will be compiled.

4.test : maven will run all the test cases and it will show how many test cases are success and how many fails.

5.package : maven will bundle our java code into a jar file inside 'target' folder.

6.install : that jar file in step 5 will be stored in the local repo.

7.deploy : maven stores the application jar file to the central repo.

**8.clean : here maven will delete and remove all the files that are generated in previous build. this phase is an isolated phase.


Note: if we execute any phase to build the maven project then maven will execute all the phases till that given phase.except phase 8.clean.

***example to execute life cycle :

>mvn clean   :- remove and delete previous build
>mvn test   : till the test phase.
>mvn deploy:
>mvn validate:
