Q2/- What is the POM, Explain the basic properties of the pom.xml file in Maven based
application.


POM stands for Project Object Model.
The pom.xml file contains information of project and configuration
information for the maven to build the project such as dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source
directory, plugin, goals etc.

Maven reads the pom.xml file, then executes the goal.

****We mainly have to write all the dependencies and properties in pom.xml file in order to use maven based repository
    and features.
    eg : <dependency>
              <groupId>mysql</groupId>
              <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
              <version>8.0.31</version>
        </dependency>

    It defines the following properties for a project :
    1.Name
    2.Version
    3.Packaging
    4.Dependencies
    5.Plugins


*** In this model entire application will be considered as an object.
*** If we add any dependencies in pom.xml file, then respective file/document gets downloaded automatically in local
    storage (.m2 folder) and need not to be downloaded again.
