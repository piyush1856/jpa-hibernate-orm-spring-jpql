Q1/ Explain the Build process of the Java Application, How the Maven helps in the
application build?



Build Process in java based project/application management:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

develpers duty/responsibility to develop a java based business application  :

1. write some source code(bunch of classes, interface...)
2.add some external  jar files to the classpath (dependencies of our application)
    in JDBC dao project, driver jar file is the dependency of our project.
3.compile the code.
4.prepare some test cases. (Unit test, Junit, Mockito, Sonar )
5.add Junit/mockito related jar files inside the classpath
6.compile  and run the test cases.
7.arrange our code in a standard folder structure
8.Do the packaging : build the jar, war file.
9.deploy this jar file/ war file to the server.

build process: keeping our project ready for execution/release is called build process.
=========================================================================================================================
Maven's Objective :

Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the
shortest period of time. In order to attain this goal, Maven deals with several areas of concern:

1.Making the build process easy
2.Providing a uniform build system
3.Providing quality project information
4.Encouraging better development practices

Maven's also provide repository so that developer should not download thousand of jar exter jar file everytime. Maven repo
are as follows :
1.central repo :- it is the maven's own repo in which it maintains all kinds of project related plugins, archetypes, jars etc.
2.remote repo : this repo is maintained within the organization for sharing plugins, archetypes and jar files for multiple
    projects withing orgnizations. ex: masairepo
3.local repo: this repo will be created inside the developer computer.  (.m2) is the name for this repo.
