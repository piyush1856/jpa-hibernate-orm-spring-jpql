 Entity Class Life Cycle ->
 =========================
        An entity class cycle is a process of performing crud operation on database with the help JPA. The stages of
        entity class life cycle is as follows :

        1. New Stage/ Transient Stage
        2. Persistence Stage
        3. Datached Stage

        1. New Stage -> If we create an object class and this class is not attached to the EntityManager object then
                          this Stage is known as new Stage
                        ex.  Employee emp = new Employee(1,"ramesh",43200");

        2. Persistence Stage -> When we assign our Persistence class object with the EntityManager object. then this object
                                will be in a persistence Stage. In this stage our object will be sync with the database table.
                                 We can't change anything in transactional area.

        3. Detached stage -> When we call the close() method or call the clear() method on the EntityManager object, then
                              all the associated entity will be in a detached state. In this stage, the entity objects will
                              be in sync with the table.


        These three stages together make a cycle like first if we call get method then we will go direct in persistence
        stage and if we will call persist or save or saveOrUpdate or update method then object will be in Transient stage
        and after that persistence stage. After that we can call close or clear method to go for detached stage and again
        coming for persist stage we can call merge method or lock method. So like that we can move one stage to another
        stage and cycle called as a Entity Class cycle.
