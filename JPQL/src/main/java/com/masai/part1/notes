JPQL : Java Persistence query language.
    -> It is defined in JPA.
    -> We write query against entity in JPQL but in SQL we write it in Database.

Query Structure :
==================
SELECT ... FROM ...(entity class name)
[WHERE]
[GROUP BY]
[HAVING]
[ORDER BY]

DELETE FROM ... [WHERE] ...
UPDATE SET ... WHERE ...

***-> In JPQL '*' is not considered : will give exception
       Instead we use alias support


NAMED QUERY :
=============
-> when query is long and have to written multiple times, you can provide alias to query,
    use createNamedQuery(""); to do the operations.

NATIVE QUERY :
==============
-> It is engaged directly with the database table rather than Entity class.
-> so we can directly write the SQL syntax.
-> It work on table name in database rather than entity class

NAMED NATIVE QUERY:
=================
-> Same as named query but directly work on database table and dynamic in nature.
