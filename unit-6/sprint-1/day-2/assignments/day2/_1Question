Limitation of JDBC-based persistence logic over the ORM.


limitation of JDBC based persistence logic:-
----------------------------------------------------
1. jdbc can't store the java objs into the table directly,becoz sql queires does not allows the java objs as input, here
    we need to convert obj data into the simple(atmoic) value to store them in a DB.
    eg : using getName(), setName() etc ..
2. jdbc code is the DB dependent code because it uses  DB software dependent queries. so our jdbc based persistence logic is not
    100% portable across various DB s/w.

3. jdbc code having boiler plate code problem (writing the same code except sql queries in multiple classes of our
    application again and again)..
    eg : making of implementation as well as usecase folder in dao pattern.
4. jdbc code throws lots of checked exceptions, programmer need to handle them.
5. After the select operation, we get the ResultSet object.this RS obj we can not transfer from one layer to another layer
    and to get the data from the ResultSet we need to know the structure of the ResultSet.
6. there is no any caching and transaction management support is available in jdbc.
