limitation of EM methods in performing CRUD operations:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------

persist();
find()
merge();
remove();



1.Retrieving Entity obj based on only ID field(PK field) @Id

2.multiple Entity obj retrival is not possible (multiple record)

3.bulk update and bulk delete is also not possible

4.to access Entity obj we can not specify some extra condition.


--to overcome the above limitation JPA has provided JPQL (java persistence query language).


JPQL:
=====



similarities bt JPQL and sql:-
----------------------------------

--keywords in the both the langauges are case insensetive

--GROUP BY,ORDER BY,where clause r similar

--aggregrate function r similar

--the way we express the condition to perform the CRUD operation is almost simmilar.


diff bt JPQL and sql:-
--------------------------
--sql queries are expressed in the term of table and columns, where as jpql query is expressed in the term of Entity class names and its variables.

--the name of the class and its variables are case sensitive.

--sql is not portable across multiple dbms, where jpql is portable.
